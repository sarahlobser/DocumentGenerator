# DocumentGenerator
### Week 7 individual project at Skill Distillery, full stack Java dev bootcamp.
### Purpose
* Learn SpringMVC
* Learn CRUD concepts

### The Document Generator concept
This is a CRUD html document generator. Use it to create an html document, save it to an ArrayList, retreive from the ArrayList, edit and rearrange snippets, and delete it. Java beans include Doc and DocIO. Each document created is of type Doc, and content is stored as an ArrayList of StringBuilders. Documents are stored (but not persisted) in an ArrayList<Doc>. Files can be written to a .html file as well.
